## Description
OOP Lab Module: A simple Java program that demonstrates the usage of common mathematical methods such as power, absolute value, and square root.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

Using terminal commands: 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/MathMethods.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd MathMethods 
```
- Compile the MathMethods.java file: 
```Java
- javac MathMethods.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java MathMethods
```
## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to enter three double values (x, y, and z). These values will be used to demonstrate various mathematical operations.

This application serves a very niche purpose; however, it can be easily modified to fufill other mathematical application purposes.
